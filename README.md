# ColocBoost for multi-context colocalization in molecular QTL and GWAS studies

This R package implements ColocBoost --- motivated and designed for colocalization analysis ([first defined here](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383)) of multiple genetic association studies --- as a frequentist multi-task variable selection regression with highly correlated regressors and sparse effects. It furnishes statistical evidences to help identify subset of regressors have non-zero effect on subset of response variables.
