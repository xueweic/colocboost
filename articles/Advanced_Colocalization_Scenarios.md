# Advanced Colocalization Scenarios with ColocBoost

This vignette uses representative simulation studies to illustrate two
advanced colocalization scenarios addressed by ColocBoost:

- **Multiple causal variants per trait**: Regions containing multiple
  causal variants, beyond the one-causal-variant-per-trait assumption.
- **Weaker effects in disease GWAS**: Shared causal signals for which
  the disease trait contributes weaker association evidence than the
  accompanying molecular traits.

## 1. Multiple causal variants within a genomic region

To reduce the combinatorial hypothesis space, Bayesian multi-trait
colocalization methods commonly assume that each trait has at most one
causal variant within a genomic region (**one-causal-variant-per-trait
assumption**). This assumption becomes increasingly restrictive as the
number of phenotypes increases and more distinct signals and
trait-sharing patterns must be resolved. Collapsing these signals into a
single-signal representation can obscure event-specific sharing
patterns, leading to missed or incorrectly localized colocalization
events. This concern has also been emphasized and evaluated for pairwise
colocalization using COLOC (V5) (Wallace, 2021, *PLOS Genetics*).

### Scenario 1: Heterogeneous effects across traits

A common multi-signal scenario arises when multiple causal variants are
shared across traits but have **heterogeneous** effects. Consider two
traits influenced by two causal variants. Under the
*one-causal-variant-per-trait* assumption, each trait is represented
only by its strongest signal (Figure 2b(i)):

- **Trait 1** is represented by causal variant 1, which has the
  strongest association with Trait 1.
- **Trait 2** is represented by causal variant 2, which has the
  strongest association with Trait 2.

The resulting single-signal representations appear as two distinct
trait-specific signals, leading to a false conclusion of no
colocalization even though both causal variants are shared across the
two traits. ColocBoost instead resolves the two shared signals as
distinct colocalization events.

### Scenario 2: Non-causal strongest marginal effect

Another multi-signal scenario occurs when a non-causal variant tags
multiple causal variants through LD and consequently has the strongest
marginal association. Distinguishing marginal association from causal
attribution motivates multi-effect fine-mapping methods such as SuSiE
(Wang et al., 2020, *JRSS B*).

Consider two traits sharing the same two causal variants. Under the
*one-causal-variant-per-trait* assumption (Figure 2b(ii)):

- **Trait 1 and Trait 2** are represented by the non-causal marginal
  lead (green dot), which has a stronger marginal association than
  either true causal variant (red dots).

The resulting single-signal representation incorrectly localizes the
colocalized signal to a non-causal variant, whereas ColocBoost resolves
the two shared causal signals as distinct colocalization events.

## 2. Colocalization with weaker effects in GWAS

In practice, it is often of interest to colocalize a disease GWAS with
multiple molecular QTL traits to elucidate the functional basis of
disease associations. An *important technical aspect* of GWAS-xQTL
colocalization is that GWAS traits often have lower per-variant
contributions to heritability than molecular xQTL traits.

### Scenario 3: Weaker effects in disease GWAS

Consider a disease GWAS and an xQTL sharing the same two causal variants
(Figure 2b(iii)):

- **xQTL** shows strong association evidence for both causal variants.
- **Disease GWAS** shows strong evidence for causal variant 1 but weaker
  evidence for causal variant 2.

COLOC (V5) identifies the event supported by the stronger GWAS signal
but misses the second event with weaker GWAS evidence. As a two-stage
approach that performs fine-mapping before colocalization, it may have
reduced sensitivity to weaker signals with limited support in the
initial single-trait analysis. ColocBoost identifies both shared signals
using its disease-prioritized colocalization approach.
