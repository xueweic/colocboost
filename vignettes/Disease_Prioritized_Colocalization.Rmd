This vignette demonstrates how to perform multi-trait colocalization analysis using a mixed-type dataset, including both individual level data and summary statistics. 
ColocBoost provides a flexible framework to integrate data both at the individual level or at the summary statistic level, 
allowing to handle scenarios where the individual data is available for some traits (like xQTLs) and the summary data is available for other traits (disease/trait GWAS).


```{r setup}
library(colocboost)
```

# 1. Loading and Analyzing Datasets

To get started, load both Ind_5traits and Sumstat_5traits datasets into your R session. Once loaded, create a mixed dataset as follows:

- For traits 1, 2, 3, 4: use individual-level gentype and phenotype data.
- For trait 5: use summary statistics data.
- Note that `LD` could be calculated from the `X` data in the `Ind_5traits` dataset, but it is not included in the `Sumstat_5traits` dataset.

### Causal variant structure
The dataset features two causal variants with indices 644 and 2289.

- Causal variant 644 is associated with traits 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Causal variant 2289 is associated with traits 2, 3, and 5 (summary level data).

```{r load-mixed-data}
# Load example data
data(Ind_5traits)
data(Sumstat_5traits) 

# Create a mixed dataset
X <- Ind_5traits$X[1:4]
Y <- Ind_5traits$Y[1:4]
sumstat <- Sumstat_5traits$sumstat[5]
LD <- get_cormat(Ind_5traits$X[[1]])
```

For analyze the specific one type of data, you can refer to the following 
tutorals [Individual Level Data Colocalization](https://statfungen.github.io/colocboost/articles/Individual_Level_Colocalization.html) and 
[Summary Level Data Colocalization](https://statfungen.github.io/colocboost/articles/Summary_Level_Colocalization.html).


# 2. Run ColocBoost (Basic usage)


The preferred format for colocalization analysis in ColocBoost using mixed-type dataset:

- **Individual level data**: `X` and `Y` are organized as lists, matched by trait index,
    - `(X[1], Y[1])` contains individuals for trait 1,
    - `(X[2], Y[2])` contains individuals for trait 2,
    - And so on for each trait under analysis.

- **Summary level data**:
    - `sumstat` is organized as a list of data.frames for all traits
    - `LD` is a matrix of linkage disequilibrium (LD) information for all variants across all traits.

This function requires specifying genotypes `X` and phenotypes `Y` from the individual-level dataset and summary statistics `sumstat` and LD matrix `LD` from summary dataset:


```{r mixd-basic}
# Run colocboost
res <- colocboost(X = X, Y = Y, sumstat = sumstat, LD = LD)

# Identified CoS
res$cos_details$cos$cos_index

# Plotting the results
colocboost_plot(res)
```

### Results Interpretation

# 3. Run ColocBoost (Disease Prioritized Colocalization)


TO-DO-LIST


```{r disease-basic}
# Run colocboost
res <- colocboost(X = X, Y = Y, sumstat = sumstat, LD = LD, focal_outcome_idx = 5)

# Identified CoS
res$cos_details$cos$cos_index

# Plotting results
colocboost_plot(res)
```



```{r disease-basic-focal}
# Plotting the focal only results
colocboost_plot(res, plot_focal_only = TRUE)
```
