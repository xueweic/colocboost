This vignette demonstrates how ColocBoost handles partial overlapping variants across traits in ColocBoost.


```{r setup}
library(colocboost)
```

### Causal variant structure

We create an example data from `Ind_5traits` with two causal variants, 644 and 2289, but each of them are only partially overlapping across traits.

- Causal variant 644 is associated with traits 1, 3, and 4, but is missing in trait 2.
- Causal variant 2289 is associated with traits 2 and 3, but is missing in trait 5.

This structure creates a realistic scenario where multiple traits from different datasets are not fully overlapping, and the causal variants are not shared across all traits.

```{r make-data}
# Load example data
data(Ind_5traits)
X <- Ind_5traits$X
Y <- Ind_5traits$Y

# Creeate causal variants with potentially LD proxies
causal_1 <- c(200:1000)
causal_2 <- c(2000:2600)

# Create missing data
X[[2]] <- X[[2]][, -causal_1, drop = FALSE]
X[[3]] <- X[[3]][, -causal_2, drop = FALSE]

# Show format
X[[2]][1:2, 1:10]
X[[3]][1:2, 1:10]
```


To run ColocBoost to the different genotypes with different causal variants, the variant names should be provided as the column names of the `X` matrices.
Otherwise, the `colocboost` function will not be able to identify the variants correctly from different genotype matrices,
and the analysis will fail with an error message `Please verify the variable names across different outcomes.`.

```{r run-code}
# Run colocboost
res <- colocboost(X = X, Y = Y)

# The number of variants in the analysis
res$data_info$n_variables

# Plotting the results
colocboost_plot(res)
```


If we perform colocalization analysis using only overlapping variables, we may fail to detect any colocalization events. 
This is because the causal variants, which are only partially overlapping across traits, are excluded during the preprocessing step. 
As a result, even though these variants are associated with some traits, they are removed from the analysis, leading to a loss of critical information. 
This highlights the importance of handling partial overlaps effectively to ensure that meaningful colocalization signals are not missed.

```{r run-code-overlap}
# Run colocboost with only overlapping variables
res <- colocboost(X = X, Y = Y, overlap_variables = TRUE)

# The number of variants in the analysis
res$data_info$n_variables

# Plotting the results
colocboost_plot(res)
```
