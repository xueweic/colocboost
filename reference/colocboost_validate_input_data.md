# Validate and Process All Input Data for ColocBoost

Internal function to validate and process both individual-level and
summary-level input data

## Usage

``` r
colocboost_validate_input_data(
  X = NULL,
  Y = NULL,
  sumstat = NULL,
  LD = NULL,
  X_ref = NULL,
  dict_YX = NULL,
  dict_sumstatLD = NULL,
  effect_est = NULL,
  effect_se = NULL,
  effect_n = NULL,
  overlap_variables = FALSE,
  M = 500,
  min_abs_corr = 0.5,
  jk_equiv_corr = 0.8,
  jk_equiv_loglik = 1,
  func_simplex = "LD_z2z",
  cos_npc_cutoff = 0.2,
  npc_outcome_cutoff = 0.2
)
```

## Arguments

- X:

  A list of genotype matrices for different outcomes, or a single matrix
  if all outcomes share the same genotypes.

- Y:

  A list of vectors of outcomes or an N by L matrix if it is considered
  for the same X and multiple outcomes.

- sumstat:

  A list of data.frames of summary statistics.

- LD:

  A list of correlation matrix indicating the LD matrix for each
  genotype. It also could be a single matrix if all sumstats were
  obtained from the same genotypes. Provide either `LD` or `X_ref`, not
  both. If neither is provided, LD-free mode is used.

- X_ref:

  A reference panel genotype matrix (N_ref x P) or a list of matrices,
  as an alternative to providing a precomputed `LD` matrix. Column names
  must include variant names matching those in `sumstat`. When the
  number of reference panel samples is less than the number of variants
  (N_ref \< P), this avoids storing the full P x P LD matrix and reduces
  memory usage. When N_ref \>= P, LD is precomputed from `X_ref`
  internally. Provide either `LD` or `X_ref`, not both. If neither is
  provided, LD-free mode is used.

- dict_YX:

  A L by 2 matrix of dictionary for X and Y if there exist subsets of
  outcomes corresponding to the same X matrix.

- dict_sumstatLD:

  A L by 2 matrix of dictionary for sumstat and LD if there exist
  subsets of outcomes corresponding to the same sumstat.

- effect_est:

  Matrix of variable regression coefficients (i.e. regression beta
  values) in the genomic region

- effect_se:

  Matrix of standard errors associated with the beta values

- effect_n:

  A scalar or a vector of sample sizes for estimating regression
  coefficients.

- overlap_variables:

  If overlap_variables = TRUE, only perform colocalization in the
  overlapped region.

- M:

  The maximum number of gradient boosting rounds for each outcome
  (default is 500).

- min_abs_corr:

  Minimum absolute correlation allowed in a confidence set.
